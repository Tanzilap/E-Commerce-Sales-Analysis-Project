   1.	Total sales revenue by month.
   2.	Top 5 best-selling products.
   3. Revenue contribution by customer segments.
   4. Identify the top regions for sales.

## Pandas Analysis:
**Objective:** Clean data, perform EDA, and create new columns 

### 1.	Clean Data:
■	Handle missing values.<br>
■	Remove duplicate rows.<br>

### 3.	EDA:
■	Analyze sales trends<br>

## Basic Visualization 
**Objective:** Create insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

○	Visualize monthly sales revenue.<br>
○	Show the top 5 products by sales quantity.<br>
○	Display revenue contribution by customer segments and top regions.<br>

## Analysis and Insights
The analysis is focused on addressing the following key business questions:

1. Which are the top 5 products by performance?
2. Which region, segment, and category generate the highest revenue?
3. How does sales revenue vary by month?
